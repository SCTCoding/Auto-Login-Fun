### Use: autologinrecovery.sh

## Auto-Login-Fun
OS X will automatically log you in, and you can get the password out–easily.

## Why?
This project is super useful for those people who don't seem to use their password ever, and forget it. Recover the password from auto login, and save the day. Also I am cheap, and I simply won't pay $50 for a tool to do this–when I can make my own in a matter of a couple hours total time reveresing and tool development.

## Usage
From an admin user run the autologinrecovery.sh script with the path to the kcpassword file as an argument (autologinrecovery.sh /private/etc/kcpassword); hit enter and a dialog will appear with the password.

## The .zip file
This is an automator application that runs a modified version of the script with AppleScript dialogs. Simple little appification of the script. It recovers nice long auto login passwords.
