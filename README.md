# Auto-Login-Fun
OS X will automatically log you in, and you can get the password out–easily.

# Why?
This project is super useful for those people who don't seem to use their password ever, and forget it. Recover the password from auto login, and save the day. Also I am cheap, and I simply won't pay $50 for a tool to do this–when I can make my own in a matter of a couple hours total time reveresing and tool development.

# Usage
Run the script from an admin account. Provide the path to the kcpassword file. Provide the password for the admin user you are using. Run the script!
